Create a CLI program named RandomString which will generate a random number of words (1..100), 
each word of random length (1..10), containing random letters (a..z) - and display them.
Use notepad and command prompt for your program.
Note: There may be changes to requirements.

Updated Requirements:
0) Modify your app to use a GUI.
Enhance your app so that it creates sentences containing a random number of words (1..15).
Each sentence should begin with an uppercase letter and end with a period / full stop.

1) Enhance your app to sort the words in lexicographical order and display in them in order in
 a second area of your GUI
Hint: You can use Arrays.sort() to sort the words
You should then write a method which validates the words are sorted correctly. Hint: String.compareTo();

2) Enhance your app to display the Hex Unicode value of the sorted words and display them in
 a third area of yoru GUI.
Format the display so it appears orderly.

3) Provide a button which will take the Hex unicode value in the third area of your GUI and convert
them to Decimal Unicode values and display them in a fourth area of your GUI.
