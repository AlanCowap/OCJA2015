In teams of 3.

A new client, the UFC, have contracted your team to develop a prototype Application on their behalf. Initially the UFC have the following five weight divisions (inclusive):
Lightweight: 145 to 155 lb (67 to 70 kg)
Welterweight: 156 to 170 lb (71 to 77 kg)
Middleweight: 171 to 185 lb (78 to 84 kg)
Light Heavyweight: 186 to 205 lb (85 to 93 kg)
Heavyweight: 206 to 265 lb (94 to 120 kg)

Your team will write a program that will allow users to enter their weight in kg or lbs and tell them which weight division they will be allowed to compete in.

Once this requirement has been met and satisfactorily demonstrated to the client, you can enhance your program to validate all user input and ensure your code is bulletproof.


Rules of the Code Challenge are:
1) You must use if - else if - else statements (no switch statements allowed)
2) You must use only a main method (no other methods or classes)
3) If this is your first code challenge, you have to code.


Observations:
Your if statements do not require lots of && operators
Reuse code, do not duplicate it.
