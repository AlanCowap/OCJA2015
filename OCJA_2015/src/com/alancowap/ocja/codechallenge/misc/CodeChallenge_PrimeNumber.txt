Create a CLI program named PrimeNumberApp which will generate a list of Prime Numbers.
A prime number is any Natural number with only two factors - itself and 1.
i.e. a positive whole number which can wholly divided by only itself and 1.
Note that 0 and 1 are not considred Prime numbers.
The requirement here is to get a demo app up ASAP, time to MVP is critical.
The deadline is 11:15am, if you don't have a demo then you miss the next funding round and go out of
business due to cash flow problems.

Use notepad and command prompt for your program.
Note: There may be changes to requirements.
